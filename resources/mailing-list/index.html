<h2 id="a-nameannouncethe-plug-announce-lista"><a name="announce">The plug-announce list</a></h2>
<p>The plug-announce list is a low-traffic moderated mailing list, used for announcing upcoming PLUG events. It averages around 3 or 4 messages per month. Subscribers of the main PLUG mailing list are automatically subscribed to the plug-announce list, so need not subscribe again. However, if you want to keep up with PLUG events, without the traffic from the main PLUG list, then subscribe to plug-announce. To subscribe, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:plug-announce-request@plug.org.au">plug-announce-request@plug.org.au</a>
 containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can also <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce">subscribe or unsubscribe over the web</a>
. There is also <a href="https://old.plug.org.au/archives/list/plug-announce.html">an archive</a>
 of all the past posts to the plug-announce list.</p>
<h2 id="a-namejobsthe-jobs-lista"><a name="jobs">The Jobs list</a></h2>
<p>We have a list for employment opportunities for those skilled in Linux and Open Source technologies - and of course for recruiters trying to find those people. Please keep descriptions clear, and do not post the same job more than once per month. You can <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/jobs/">subscribe or unsubscribe</a>
 over the web.</p>

<h2 id="a-nameofftopicthe-off-topic-lista"><a name="offtopic">The off-topic list</a></h2>
<p>We have a separate mailing list for PLUG members to use for discussions which are not necessarily of interest to the rest of PLUG. It can be a place to rant and rave, debate pedantic points of language, discuss non-Linux-related news or even argue about the merits of capitalism. Generally, conversations which drift too far from any relevance to Linux move to the off-topic list when people start complaining. To join it, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:off-topic-request@plug.org.au">off-topic-request@plug.org.au</a>
 containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can post to it by sending messages to <a href="mailto:off-topic@plug.org.au">off-topic@plug.org.au</a>
. You can also <a href="http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/off-topic">subscribe or unsubscribe over the web</a>
. There is also <a href="https://old.plug.org.au/archives/list/plug-off-topic.html">an archive</a>
 of all the past posts to the off-topic list.</p>
<h2 id="a-nameuserconfthe-userconf-lista"><a name="userconf">The userconf list</a></h2>
<p>We have a separate mailing list for PLUG members to use for discussions about the Linux.conf.au Bid. To join it, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:userconf-request@plug.org.au">userconf-request@plug.org.au</a>
