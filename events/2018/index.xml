      <title>October Talk: Creating Deb Packages by Alastair Irvine</title>

      <description>Once upon a time, Debian was a GNU/Linux distribution that was mainly for hobbyists. It always existed in the shadow of commercial distributions such as Red Hat, and their derivatives. Then Canonical used it to create Ubuntu, and the world changed. (In the interim though, there were a lot of businesses relying on Debian as a stable, low-TCO server OS with good security support.)
If you are running Debian on a personal host or in production, you might have wondered how Debian packages work and whether you have a use case for which they could make your life simpler.</description>

      <title>April Talk: Confined applications on the desktop by James Henstridge</title>
      <link>http://www.plug.org.au/events/2018/desktop-snaps/</link>

      <description>Traditionally, Linux distributions have relied on package archives maintained by groups of trusted maintainers. While this works well, users often end up looking to third party sources for newer versions or software missing from the main archive. This can reduce the security of a system, since traditional packaging systems place a lot of trust in the package maintainers (e.g. running scripts as root during package installation).
This talk will look at the snapd packaging system, which is inspired by the confinement strategies used for smart phone applications.</description>
