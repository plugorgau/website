      <description>PLUG is looking for a new Logo.
We have entries so far from Peter Taekema (Great Southern Computer Services-http://gscomputers.com.au ) and Jason Nicholls. Both have earned themselves a year&amp;rsquo;s membership to PLUG (which is worth double as of 1 July 2011!).
One of the desired features of our new logo is to have it in SVG (vector) format if possible, so if anyone wants to have a play with any of the submitted entries (or indeed a fresh entry) then you will still be eligible for the free membership (or renewal).</description>
