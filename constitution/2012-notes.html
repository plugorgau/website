<p>This page serves as notes to the changes being implemented in the proposed constitution at <a href="http://www.plug.org.au/Constitution/Proposed2012" title="http://www.plug.org.au/Constitution/Proposed2012">http://www.plug.org.au/Constitution/Proposed2012</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed constitution was creating using the Western Australian Ministry of Fair Trading Model Constitution from 2011 as a base. Some changes were brought across from the existing PLUG constitution (<a href="http://www.plug.org.au/Constitution/2010" title="http://www.plug.org.au/Constitution/2010">http://www.plug.org.au/Constitution/2010</a>), then more changes were introduced to fix problems with the existing PLUG constitution.</p>
<p>Changes from the model constitution:</p>
<p>Rule 1.<br />
Clearly the name of the association has been retained as it was.</p>
<p>Rule 2.<br />
We have defined our financial year to be from January 1st to December 31st: this allows us to continue to hold our AGM at the beginning of the calendar year as we have done in the past; rule 16(1)b requires us to hold our AGM within 4 months from the end of the financial year.</p>
<p>"in writing" has been brought across from the existing constitution to explicitly include email.</p>
<p>Rule 3(1).<br />
The objects have brought across verbatim from the existing constitution.</p>
<p>Rule 5(1).<br />
Qualifications for memberships remain the same as in the existing constitution.</p>
<p>Rule 5(2).<br />
This has been changed to more closely reflect our current practice of taking membership details and money from a new member: we've removed the need for a proposing and seconding member and for their to be a signed application. Subclause (a) refers to applications in writing, but (b) then allows the committee to enable other ways.</p>
<p>Rule 7(2).<br />
We've changed this to have memberships renewable on the anniversary of the original payment date; ie: your membership lasts for one year from the day you first pay it, rather than until the end of the financial year.</p>
<p>Rule 10(1)(e).<br />
This has been changed to require "at least one and not more than three" other people; it will allow us to have "official" OCMs. (The model rules leave the number blank.)</p>
<p>Rule 15(1).<br />
We've specified that the Committee must meet at least twice a year, this is the same as our current constitution requires (and is less than our actual meeting schedule).</p>
<p>Rule 15(4).<br />
Here we specify that the quorum is 50% of committee members, rounded up.</p>
<p>Rule 16(1)(c)(i).<br />
We've specified that five members can request a Special General Meeting, which is the same as the current constitution.</p>
<p>Rule 17(1)<br />
Here we specify that the quorum for a general meeting is 25% of members, rounded up. This replaces the requirement of 30 members that proved so onerous for the 2011 AGM.</p>
<p>Changes from the current constitution:<br />
Rule 1.<br />
Defined our financial year to be from January 1st to December 31st.</p>
<p>Rule 4.<br />
The new model rules have a specific list of powers, listed in clauses (a) to (h).</p>
<p>Rule 5.<br />
Subrule (2) differs between our current and the model. We've altered the model rule to keep it more in the spirit of the current constitution.<br />
Subrules (3) to (5) have been added in from  the new model rules.</p>
<p>Rule 6.<br />
The new model rules insert subrule (2) (renumbering the old (2) to (3)), allowing the members to specifiy that the register of members be kept in a different place from the Secretary's place of residence.</p>
<p>Rule 7.<br />
Substantially the same, except that we've detailed an individual date of expiry of membership.</p>
<p>Rule 8.<br />
Changes in wording, but substantially the same.</p>
<p>Rule 10.<br />
Mostly the same, except that the new model rules remove any reference to the makeup of the committee when the club is first incorporated (which is no longer relevant to us) and they do not allow an office bearer to hold more than one position. </p>
<p>The important change here is that we have added OCMs to the list of official positions.</p>
<p>Another change is that the new model rules specify that those nominating for a committee position now have up to 7 days before the AGM to nominate, rather than 28 days as in the old constitution. (Naturally, they also removed the requirement for notice of nominations to go out with the AGM notice, as this would not make sense.)</p>
<p>The nomination and election process has also been clarified in the new model rules.</p>
<p>Rule 14.<br />
Clause (g) has been added by the new model rules, allowing a General Meeting to remove someone from the Committee.</p>
<p>Rule 15.<br />
Subrule (4) has been modified to have the quorum be 50% of the committee, which is a more workable number for meetings. Note that with 3 OCMs, this would still require at least one office bearer to be at a meeting, unless there are vacancies in the committee.<br />
Subrules (7) and (8) have been added by the new model rules: (7) clarifies that employees don't necessarily have a financial conflict of interest which is not relevant to us; (8) requires the Secretary to record conflicts of interest in the minutes.</p>
<p>Rule 16.<br />
Subrule (4) was changed by the new model rules to require the club to provided callers of a SGM with members particulars.<br />
Subrule (5) and (6) have been merged together in the new model rules.</p>
<p>Rule 17(1).<br />
This is where we've changed the quorum from 30 members to 25%.</p>
<p>Rule 21.<br />
The new model rules update this to be more specific about the process of changing the rules of the constitution.</p>
<p>Rule 24.<br />
This rule has been added in the new model rules (renumbering the old 24 to 25), and sets out a process for mediation of disputes.</p>
